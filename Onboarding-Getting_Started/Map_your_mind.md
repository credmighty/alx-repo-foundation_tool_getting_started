Tasks
0. Being a square keeps you from going around in circles.
mandatory
Score: 93.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)
To develop an algorithm

calculate the sum of squares of given input of numbers

you are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.

1. Order marches with weighty and measured strides. Disorder is always in a hurry.
mandatory
Score: 92.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)

2. It is not enough to run; one must start in time
mandatory
Score: 96.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)
To develop an algorithm

Calculate a running sum

A user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum and when a negative number is encountered, stop adding numbers and write out the final result

you are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.
